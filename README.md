# Login System in Django
The current project is nearly complete, with user CRUD operations and authentication features fully implemented. However, there's still room to enhance the permissions system for better control over page access.

Looking ahead, my next goal is to start a new project focused on integrating social authentication, allowing users to log in using popular platforms like LinkedIn, GitHub, Google, and others.
